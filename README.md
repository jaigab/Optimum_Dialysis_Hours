  Python Projects
  </h1>

This repository contains all of my personal projects written in python. Each folder contains the script and data for a specific project unless told otherwise.

These projects may be "complete" but they are regularly updated to improve efficiency and readibility. 

If you already have a good understanding of python 3, you can dive straight into the python file of each project. If not, there is an accompanying jupyter notebook with explanations on what the code is doing.
