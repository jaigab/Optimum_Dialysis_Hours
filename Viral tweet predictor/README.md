<h1> Viral tweet predictor </h1>

Kmeans++ clustering model to find out whether specific attribute groups exhibit more stereotypically masculine or feminine traits based on survey results.

<h2> Background </h2>
  
FiveThirtyEight and WNYC studios used the survey linked [here](https://github.com/jaigab/Python-Projects/blob/main/Masculinity%20survey/masculinity-survey.pdf) to get their male readers' thoughts on masculinity. The survey results were utilised in their article *What Do Men Think It Means To Be A Man?* which can be found [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-do-men-think-it-means-to-be-a-man/).

I used supervised clustering methods to find the ratio of members of specific attribute groups that exhiit sterotypically masculine or feminine traits based on the survey results.
